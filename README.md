## 🧠 Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
PseudoNerds

### Team Members:  
- Aditi Nadiger  
- Megha Bhat  
- Pooja Hosalli
- Pooja Kolli  


### Approach: 

We chose to tackle rural commerce because of the vast untapped potential in rural India. Rural entrepreneurs, such as farmers, artisans, and local businesses, often face significant barriers in reaching urban markets due to a lack of connectivity, resources, and access to digital platforms. Our goal was to create a platform that empowers these sellers, helps them reach broader markets, and enables buyers to discover authentic regional products. 

#### Key challenges addressed
- *Product Discovery:* Rural products often lack visibility in urban markets. Our platform makes it easier for buyers to discover authentic local goods while promoting the regional identity of the products. 
- *Low Digital Literacy:* Many rural sellers lack familiarity with digital tools, which could make onboarding difficult. We overcame this by creating simplified onboarding processes,  to make the process smoother for sellers, ensuring they could easily upload their products and manage their business.
